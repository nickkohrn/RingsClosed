This is a personal app I built to make it easier to identify streaks related to closing my Apple Watch Activity Rings.
Sadly, I can't seem to keep my streaks going... ðŸ«£

Check out the [`feature/streaks-ui`](https://github.com/nickkohrn/RingsClosed/tree/feature/streaks-ui) branch. As with most of my personal projects, I live on feature branches until I find time/motivation to come back to them.
